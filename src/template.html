            <h3>Account system</h3>
            <p>
                HEX BOIS has its own accounts system built on Google's SSO. Players with an account are able to customize the colour of their hexagons as well as purchase 'skins' in the <a href="https://hexbois.com/shop" target="_blank">shop</a> to add images to their hexagons. These purchases help the game's development. The account system also allows for fine tune moderation controls within the game as well as other cool features like switching devices during a match.
            </p>
            <p>
                To keep the barrier of entry to play as low as possible, accounts are optional, players are encouraged to create one, but all gameplay is available to 'guests' and playing is as easy as picking a name and pressing play!
            </p>

            <h3>Mobile compatibility</h3>
            <p>
                With a modern, responsive website HEX BOIS fully supports the mobile gaming experience, all from within the browser, on the same website as desktop players. This means HEX BOIS is available to everyone, from the same codebase!
            </p>

                <b>Voxorp has three main elements of gameplay</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Spaceships.</b> As you progress through the game your ship grows and provides more opportunity to customize its functionality with 'modules'
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Base building.</b> Using the resources you collect in the game, you can create a base to claim your part of the map. Bases are complex, they require their own power system and defenses
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Alliances. </b>The robust alliance system allows players from around the world to collaborate on designing a base, defending their territory and battling it out with other alliances in massive space battles
                    </li>
                </ul>
